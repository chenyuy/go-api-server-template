This is the template I use to start a new project for a server written in Go. The stack currently includes:
- [sqlc](https://github.com/kyleconroy/sqlc) for generating SQL queries
- Postgresql for database ([pgx](https://github.com/jackc/pgx) for db driver)
- [Gorilla Mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux) for router
